This is a CNN that will predict nucleosome locations in a box from voxelized DNA density data

To run this requires the following python packages:
numpy
pandas
torch
torchvision
jupyter
ipyvolume

Additionally, if more training data is required, the 1CPN LAMMPS package (found at https://uchic.ag/1cpn ) will need to be installed.
